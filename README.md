## Contributing

Due to school or work, the original team members may not be able to contribute as much after the end of the program, but at Conflux, we have a strong community.
Thanks for taking the time to contribute! Contributions are what makes the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make will benefit everybody else and are **greatly appreciated**.

Please try to create bug reports that are:

-   _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
-   _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
-   _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
-   _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.

You could use [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) to check for common markdown style inconsistency.
